      <h1 class="bio">Benny Vazquez-Elvir Bio</h1>
      <p class="bio">I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I have been
        playing video games and
        surrounded by technology ever since I was a grade schooler. I adored the amount of fun and the kinds of things
        you can accomplish
        with video games and tech. My dream was to become a video game developer but as I grew older, I learned it was
        much more
        complicated than that. When I went into High School, I found out that they had a diverse Computer Science
        curriculum and I jumped
        at the chance to take as many classes as I could. My love for Computer Science flared after I took so many
        classes and it naturally
        led me to major it in college.
        <br>I was always considered the smart kid during elementary and it continued up until High School. Due to family
        issues at home and my
        motivation dwindling, my grades started to drop. Eventually I met someone that helped me get back on my feet and
        ever since my
        junior year of High School, I have been getting straight As and trying as hard as I can to succeed. I have even
        been trying to start my
        own business lately with YouTube and Twitch. Also, I was able to get into the Google Computer Science Summer
        Institute Program
        which really let me dive more into how awesome CS has been! I hope to work at a big company like Google one day
        and make
        a big difference! I am quite the ambitious person and will never back down from a challenge or a chance to learn
        something new!</p>
